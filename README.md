# 🏠 Property Management System

## 📋 What in the Actual * is This?

Welcome to our Internet Programming assignment - a full-stack property management system that's here to save us all from F grades and existential crises. We're building this because our IP teacher said, "Make something useful," and honestly, managing properties sounds more useful than another to-do list app.

## 🎯 What We're Building (Besides Our GPA)
### The Three-Way Portal System (No, Not That Kind):

- `/admin` - The God Mode 🦸‍♂️
  - Where we pretend we know what we're doing
  - Can delete users when they annoy us
  - Has all the pretty graphs that probably don't mean anything

- `/owner` - For the Property Lords 🏰
  - Where landlords count their money 💰
  - Can evict tenants with one click (kidding... mostly)
  - Pretends to care about maintenance requests

- `/tenant` - Where Renters Become Adults 🧑‍💼
  - Pays rent online instead of cash
  - Submits maintenance requests for that leaky toilet
  - Pretends they didn't break anything

### The Behind-the-Scenes Magic:

- `/includes` - The brain 🧠 (where the magic happens until it breaks)
- `/assets` - Making things pretty 💅 (because ugly code gets F's)
- `/uploads` - Where documents go to get lost forever 📁

## 🛠️ Our Tech Toolbox (The Stuff That Might Actually Work)

| Frontend | Backend | Database |
|----------|---------|----------|
| HTML5 (hopefully) | PHP (pray for us) | MySQL (please don't die) |
| CSS3 (kinda) | Coffee | Luck |
| JavaScript (when it feels like it) | Tears | Google searches |

## 🚀 Let's Get This Party Started! (Installation Guide for Mere Mortals)

```bash
# 1. Clone this masterpiece (and hope it works):
git clone https://github.com/our-awesome-team/property-management

# 2. Make XAMPP do the heavy lifting:
# - Start Apache (cross fingers)
# - Start MySQL (light a candle)
# - Sacrifice a keyboard to the coding gods

# 3. The "It Should Work Maybe" Setup:
cd property-management
# Move this to your htdocs and pray
# Import database.sql and hope no errors
# Change passwords from 'password' to something else (please)

# 4. Try not to break everything on the first try
# 5. When it breaks (because it will), cry a little
# 6. Google the error message for 3 hours
# 7. Realize it was a missing semicolon
# 8. Celebrate with virtual high-fives! 🎉
